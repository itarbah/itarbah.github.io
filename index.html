      <h1>Welcome to My Profile</h1> 
      <p>My name is <b>Tarbah Fatma</b>. I am currently an undergraduate at York University studying Information Technology. I have yet to complete any IT or coding related projects, but hope to create or participate in some in the near future. </p>
	<p> 
During High School I had experimented with various fields and paths, such as volunteering for a hospital and trying out IB. Ultimately I found out I have a love for tech and wished to pursue a career out of it. Technology had always fascinated me since I was a child and choosing to pursue a tech related field felt like the right decision for me.

	<p>
I am excited to create my first website and hope to either expand upon it or create more websites as I learn.

I have volunteered in a hospital under the <b>William Osler Health System</b>. In this Hospital I explored and inquired about the medical field to see if it was right for me. Unfortunately I found the environment to be very stressful so I chose to stay clear of any medical related paths. During my time volunteering I have found a much deeper respect for all those who choose to pursue medicine or are currently in the field. My experience volunteering at a hospital has allowed me to learn a lot, such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Management</li>
	<li>Working Under Pressure</li>
	<li>Patience</li>
	</ul>

During highschool I was wondering if higher education could also be a possibility for me. So I had enrolled in the <b>IB Program</b> or the <b> International Baccalaureate Program</b>. This program was very academically challenging, but despite this I believe that this program has helped me grow as a student. In this program I had learned:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Discipline</li>
	<li>Efficiency </li>
	<li>Problem-Solving</li>
	</ul>
